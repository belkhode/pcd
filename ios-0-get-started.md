# Getting Started with iOSThe basic steps for SDK setup are initialization, followed by registration. Content begins prepositioning onto the device after registration. Your app is notified via delegate callbacks as files change status. Cached contents are accessible individually or as data sets.

## Requirements and Dependencies

- iOS 8 or later.- A PCD SDK license key is required.
- In order to preposition content, the app must enable Background Execution, Remote Notifications, and App Transport Security.


## SDK Contents 
When you download the PCD SDK zip, the contents include:Â 

* A docs folder - with documentation for API reference
* examples folder - 
* iphoneos folder - 
* iphonesimulator folder - 
* vocSdk.framework file - 
* Integration guide - 

## Trying the Sample App

The easiest way to get started is to open one of the examples in the <tt>examples/</tt> folder. Using your SDK license key, you can substitue that for the existing key and run the app.
