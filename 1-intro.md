# Introduction

The Predictive Content Delivery (PCD) SDK allows users to download videos intelligetntly to mobile devices. Users can download videos in three ways:

* Predictive - Users set preferences and/or subscribe, and video content is automatically downloaded to their devive. 
* Download to Go - Users initiate downloads by browsing your video catalog.
* Peer-to-Peer (P2) - Android users sharing a Wifi Hotspot can share videos with each other. 

A sophisticated Download Manager checks the battery, device storage, network, and other variables to make sure that the video transfer will succeed. Errors are thrown if the video transfer fails. 

Downloads  continue whether the app is active in the foreground, running in the background, or entirely closed. In addition, the SDK acts as a data cache, providing access to content along with its current download state. 

## Audience

This document is for developers implementing the PCD SDK; deep knowledge of Android and/or iOS is assumed. 

There are separate instructions for Android and iOS. Configuring your project to support these platforms is covered in the following chapters.
